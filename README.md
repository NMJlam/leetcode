# Process

1) Observe what the question is asking you
  - write down the exact question prompt in natural language

3) Think of extreme test cases that could test your approach
   - At least 2 test cases that are extreme, ideally be exhaustive

4) Formulate an approach given the test cases
   - Discuss complexity both time and space
   - Discuss the naive and the optimised approach - why is one better than the other?

5) Start coding
   - Explain the code with comments, followed with a line of code
