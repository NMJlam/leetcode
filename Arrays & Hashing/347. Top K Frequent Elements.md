## Approach 
---
**Outline:**
The question is asking to return the top `k` frequent elements, what this means that if we have:
```python
arr = [1,11,1,1,2,2,4,5]
'''
We should return [1] if k = 1
We should return [1, 2] if k = 2
'''
```

**Test cases:**
```python
arr = [1,1,1,1,1]
# k = 4, would never happen because we ensure that k < unique elems in the list
```

```python
arr = [1,2,4,4,4]
# if k = 2, then what do we return?
```
> This case might never happen, because "all answers are unique" -> moving forward with the assumption
> If the test cases bring it up we will resolve later

**Describe the Algorithm:**
##### Naive approach:
1)  Count all the elements 
2) Sort them and then return the first 2 index
Complexity $O(N * Log(N))$

We will implement that first to ensure that we will solve the problem and then improve on it later
```python
class Solution:
	def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
		# convert the nums list into a counter object
		counter = Counter(nums)
		
		# convert the list into a counter
		countList = list(counter.items())
		
		# sort the elements based on the count
		sortedList = sorted(countList, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
		
		# return the top k elements
		return [sortedList[i][0] for i in range(k)]
```

###### Improved approach:
1) transform the list into a counter object first 
2) `heapify()` the entire counter list
3)  `pop` off the heap for `k` times for each elem
Complexity: $O(K * log(n))$

> This approach is better because we can create a data structure that stores the top `k` elements in $O(N)$ time
```python
class Solution:
	
	def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
		# Count the items
		numsCounter = list(Counter(nums).items())
		
		# We need to reverse the tuples such that [count, elem]
		swappedList = list(map(lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]),
								numsCounter))
		
		# heapfiy the list
		# NOTE: heapif creates a min heap not a max heap
		heapq.heapify(swappedList)
		
		# pop off the k elements from the heap
		res = []
		for i in range(k):
			_, num = heapq.heappop(swappedList)
			res.append(num)
		
		return res
```
